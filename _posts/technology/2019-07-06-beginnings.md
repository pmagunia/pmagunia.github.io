<h6>UPDATE - January 3, 2020</h6>
<p>Just got back my grade for the first semester and I completed the Cloud Networking course successfully with full credit (4 hours). My GPA is a 3.67. Looking forward to next semester's Cloud Computing Applications course. The semester starts January 21, 2020. There will be a final <em>and</em> mid-term. Good luck Parag!</p>

<p>I recently got admitted to the <a href="https://www.illinois.edu">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. Their MCS (Master of Computer Science) program has strong data science requirements. I'm looking forward to the Cloud Computing courses offered as part of the degree requirements starting this Fall with Cloud Networking. You can find my personal <a href="http://psmagunia.web.illinois.edu">Illinois.edu homepage</a> on the web.</p>
<p>I first found out about the program through <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>. I had taken a couple of classes on this platform in Agile and Angular website development. Applying to the program was not that difficult. I did have to supply transcripts but this is necessary for any program applied to in post-secondary education. You can find my <a href="https://pmagunia.com/assets/images/Resume.pdf">Drupal website development resume</a> also on the web. I'm currently a contract developer for <a href="https://www.newyorkfamilyhistory.org">NYGBS</a> which is a non-profit that helps people find their family history.</p>
<p>My Cloud Networking class starts in August and I will keep this blog updated with my progress. Everybody is recommending I follow through with my admission so there is a strong possibility that I will.</p>

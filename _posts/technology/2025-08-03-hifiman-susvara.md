About a week ago I ordered the Hifiman Susvara headphones. I bought the 3.5mm refurbished version. They still haven't arrived because that particular model was out of stock. They upgraded my purchase from refurbished to open-box at no additional cost. The customer service rep said the open-box versions have less wear to them.

On their warranty page it said the Susvara's have a one month return period with 3 year warranty. I bought an Apple USB-C to 3.5mm headphone jack and also the Aune S17 Pro Evo to drive them. The headpones are rated at something around 80 ohms I think. I've heard they're very difficult to drive. Here is the stack I planto use:

{% highlight console %}
2019 iMac -> Qutest -> Aune S17 Pro Evo -> Susvara
{% endhighlight %}

I'm not sure what USB cable I am using for the connection between the iMac and Qutest. For the connection between the Qutest and Aune amplifier I am using Audioquest Evergreen RCA cable. For the link to the Susvara, I am using the stock cable.

Fedex has told me it will be here Wednesday. Will update this page again once i have tried them out.

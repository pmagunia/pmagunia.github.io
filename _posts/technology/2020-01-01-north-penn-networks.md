<p>2019 was a very good year thanks to two contracts that took place at the beginning and end of the year. Both were related to Drupal with some hints of AWS. I got to configure load balancers and also a large RDS MySQL instance. I signed non-disclosure agreements with my client's so I'm not able to mention their name though one of them was a large food service company based out of the midwest US and the other was for a travel sight that sees a lot of visitors.</p>
<p>As I'm currently a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I'm limiting the amount of work I do. You can find out more about my education on my <a href="/2019/07/06/beginnings.html">Illinois blog post</a>. It lists the mentions the Illinois MCS program which I'm enrolled in. I'm able to balance my work life and school life without much effort most of the time. I watch the lectures and do machine problems on the weekend.</p>
<p>You can find out more about <a href="https://www.northpenn.net">North Penn Networks</a> at it's website. North Penn Networks is my single member limited liability company I do work out of. I figure a LLC provides more liability protection than a sole proprietorship so on all my contracts I sign it with my company. I haven't run into any problems (knock on wood) but I try to be careful. At one point my company was insured through <a href="https://www.hiscox.com">Hiscox</a>. They provided some peace-of-mind for the travel agency site I was working on at a very reasonable rate - I think it was around $40 per month. I didn't have to see an agent and I did everything online. If you want to cancel, you do have to call their number. I got a pro-rated refund when I cancelled. I'm not affiliated with them but if you are looking for business liability protection I do recommend them.</p>

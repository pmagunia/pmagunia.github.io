<p>2019 was a very good year thanks to two contracts. Both were related to Drupal with some hints of AWS. I got to configure load balancers and also a large RDS MySQL instance. I signed non-disclosure agreements with my client's so I'm not able to mention their name though one of them was a large food service company based out of the Midwest and the other was for a travel site that sees a lot of visitors.</p>
<p>As I'm currently a student at the UIUC, I'm limiting the amount of work I do. You can find out more about my education on my <a href="/2019/07/06/beginnings.html">Illinois blog post</a>. It lists the mentions the Illinois MCS program which I'm enrolled in. I'm able to balance my work life and school life without much effort most of the time. I watch the lectures and do machine problems on the weekend.</p>

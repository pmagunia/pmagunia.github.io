I passed the AWS Developer exam at the associates level today. I'm kind of surprised since I had to guess alot. I guess they were educated guesses. I was able to eliminate some of the answers based on my work experience with AWS. I think my company will reimburse me for the expense of the exam. I didn't prep alot. I just wanted to take it to see where I stood and how much studying I would need to pass.

Trying to keep things in perspective and remember what truly matters. If I had everything I need, would I know?

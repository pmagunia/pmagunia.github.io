<p>A numeral system is a way of representing numbers, not to be confused with number systems which classify numbers based on properties.</p>

<p>The binary numeral system has only two digits, 0 and 1. Every decimal number is represented with some combination of 0 and 1 in binary.</p>

<p>Suppose we had a binary number like 10110 that we wish to represent in decimal. How are we going to convert 10110 to decimal?</p>

<p>A numbers <em>place</em> in the decimal numeral system is based on some power of 10; each digit in a decimal number is multiplied by some power of ten to get its value. In binary, the base number is 2; so every digit is multiplied by some power of two. The exponent is determined by the number of digits to the left or right of the decimal.</p>

<p>In the decimal numeral system, the <em>ones</em> place is held by $ 10^0 = 1$. There is also a ones place in binary: $ 2^0 $ which is also equal to 1. In our number, 10110 there is a 0 in the ones place. So the ones place holds no value. $ 0 \times 10^1 = 0 $</p>

<p>The next place in the decimal numeral system is the <em>tens</em> place because $ 10^1 $  is ten. We don't have a tens place in binary. We have a <em>twos</em> place because $2^1$ is 2. In our number that we wish to convert, 10110, We have a 1 in the twos place. $1 \times 2^1 = 2. $</p>

<p>So far we have examined two places and our tally is 2 = 2 + 0. The next digit is the <em>fours</em> place because $ 2^2 $ is four. We have a 1 in the fours place. $1 \times 2^2=4 $. So our tally is 4 + 2 + 0 = 6.</p>

<p>The next digit is the <em>eights</em> place. We have a zero there so we don't need to tally anything.</p>

<p>The last place to examine in 10110 is the <em>sixteens</em> place, and we have a 1 there. $1 \cdot 2^4 = 16 $.</p>

<p>So our final tally is 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 22. So $ 10110_2=22_{10} $ . The subscripted numbers tell us the numeral system of that particular number.</p>

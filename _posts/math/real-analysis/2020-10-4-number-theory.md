<dt><strong>Factor</strong></dt>
<dd>to <em>factor</em> means to write as a product</dd>

<p>When factoring, it is often useful to list only the <em>prime</em> factors. Usually, we do not list 1 as a factor.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Prime</strong></dt>
<dd>A <em>prime</em> number is a natural number (positive, whole) only divisible by 1 and itself. A prime number must also be greater than 1. 2 is the first prime number. 2 is the only even prime number.</dd>
<dt><strong>Composite</strong></dt>
<dd>A <em>composite</em> number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not prime.</dd>
<dt>Factor 26</dt>
<dd>$ 2 \cdot 13 $</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Factor 125</dt>
<dd>$ 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 $</dd>
<dt><strong>Least common multiple</strong> (lcm)</dt>
<dd>The <em>least common multiple</em> of two numbers is the smallest number evenly divisible by both numbers (no remainder).</dd>
</dl>

<p>The least common multiple of 3 and 6 is 6.</p>

<p>What is the least common multiple of 3 and 4? Write out several multiples until a number matches both.</p>

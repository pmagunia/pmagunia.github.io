<p>A <strong>ring</strong> is a set $R$ with the usual operations of multiplication and addition from $R \times R \rightarrow R$ which satisfy the properties of:</p>
<ol>
<li>associativity under addition</li>
<li>commutativity under addition</li>
<li>the existence of additive identity</li>
<li>the existence of an additive inverse</li>
<li>associativity under multiplication</li>
<li>distributivity across addition</li>
</ol>
<p>These properties are defined in the above mentioned link to the page real number axioms.</p>

<p>If the additional property of commutativity under multiplication holds then that ring is called a <strong>commutative ring</strong>. If there exists a multiplicative identity then it is called a <strong>ring with unit</strong>. A <strong>field</strong> is a commutive ring with unit with the existence of a multiplicative inverse for each element in $R$ except the element 0. A field allows for the existence of fractions since any fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ can be written in terms of an multiplicative inverse such as $\frac{a}{b}^{-1}.$ The usual method of fractional addition and multiplication hold in a field.</p>

<p>A field is said to be an <strong>ordered field</strong> if there exists a subset $P$ of $R$ such that</p>

<ol><li>$0 \notin P$</li>
<li>if $a \neq 0$, then $a$ or $-a$ is an element of $P$ (but not both)</li>
<li>if a and b are elements of $P$, then $a+b$ and $ab$ are elements of $P$</li>
</ol>
<p>It should now be apparent that $P$ is the set of positive numbers. An ordered ring allows for the existence of the $<$ relation and many of the properties.</p>

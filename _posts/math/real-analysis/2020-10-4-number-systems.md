<p>An agreement has not been reached whether the natural numbers begin with 0 or 1. The symbol for the integers, $\mathbb{Z}$, comes from the 
German word, zahlen, meaning 'numbers.' $\sqrt{2}$ is example of an irrational number whose decimal representation does not 
terminate and can not be expressed as a fraction. The real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$, are the union of the irrational and rational numbers. Hence, $\sqrt{2}$  is a real number. The real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers, $\mathbb{C}$. Complex numbers have the imaginary root, $\sqrt{-1}$ which has many uses in electrical engineering. The relationship between the number systems can be expressed as follows: $\mathbb{N} \subset  \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}$.</p>

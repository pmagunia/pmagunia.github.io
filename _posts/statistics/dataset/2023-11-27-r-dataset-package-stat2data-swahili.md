<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">Swahili</span> data set which pertains to Swahili. The <span class="mono">Swahili</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">Stat2Data</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">Swahili</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("Swahili")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">Swahili</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">Swahili</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("Stat2Data")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>.

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Hamisi Babusa, a Kenyan scholar, administered a survey to 480 students from Pwani and Nairobi provinces about their attitudes towards the Swahili language. In addition, the students took an exam on Swahili. From each province, the students were from 6 schools (3 girls schools and 3 boys schools) with 40 students sampled at each school, so half of the students from each province were males and the other half females. The survey instrument contained 40 statements about attitudes towards Swahili and students rated their level of agreement to each. Of these questions, 30 were positive questions and the remaining 10 were negative questions. On an individual question the most positive response would be assigned a value of 5 while the most negative response would be assigned a value of 1. By summing (adding) the responses to each question, we can find an overall Attitude Score for each student. The highest possible score would be 200 (an individual who gave the most positive possible response to every question). The lowest possible score would be 40 (an individual who gave the most negative response to every question).</p>

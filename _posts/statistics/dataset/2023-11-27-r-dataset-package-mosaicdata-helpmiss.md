<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">HELPmiss</span> data set which pertains to Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary Care. The <span class="mono">HELPmiss</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">mosaicData</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">HELPmiss</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("HELPmiss")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">HELPmiss</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">HELPmiss</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("mosaicData")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The HELP study was a clinical trial for adult inpatients recruited from a detoxification unit. Patients with no primary care physician were randomized to receive a multidisciplinary assessment and a brief motivational intervention or usual care, with the goal of linking them to primary medical care.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Eligible subjects were adults, who spoke Spanish or English, reported alcohol, heroin or cocaine as their first or second drug of choice, resided in proximity to the primary care clinic to which they would be referred or were homeless. Patients with established primary care relationships they planned to continue, significant dementia, specific plans to leave the Boston area that would prevent research participation, failure to provide contact information for tracking purposes, or pregnancy were excluded.</p>
<p>Subjects were interviewed at baseline during their detoxification stay and follow-up interviews were undertaken every 6 months for 2 years. A variety of continuous, count, discrete, and survival time predictors and outcomes were collected at each of these five occasions.</p>
<p>This dataset is a superset of the HELPrct data with 17 subjects with partially observed data on some of the baseline variables. This is a subset of the HELPfull data which includes 5 timepoints and many additional variables.</p>

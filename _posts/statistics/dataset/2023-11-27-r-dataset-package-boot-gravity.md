<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">gravity</span> data set which pertains to Acceleration Due to Gravity. The <span class="mono">gravity</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">boot</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">gravity</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("gravity")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">gravity</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">gravity</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("boot")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-61674.csv">gravity R data set</a></span>. The size of this file is about 585 bytes.</p><h2>Acceleration Due to Gravity</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The <code>gravity</code> data frame has 81 rows and 2 columns.</p>
<p>The <code>grav</code> data set has 26 rows and 2 columns.</p>
<p>Between May 1934 and July 1935, the National Bureau of Standards in Washington D.C. conducted a series of experiments to estimate the acceleration due to gravity, <em>g</em>, at Washington. Each experiment produced a number of replicate estimates of <em>g</em> using the same methodology. Although the basic method remained the same for all experiments, that of the reversible pendulum, there were changes in configuration.</p>
<p>The <code>gravity</code> data frame contains the data from all eight experiments. The <code>grav</code> data frame contains the data from the experiments 7 and 8. The data are expressed as deviations from 980.000 in centimetres per second squared.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre>
gravity
</pre>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>This data frame contains the following columns:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>g</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The deviation of the estimate from 980.000 centimetres per second squared.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>series</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor describing from which experiment the estimate was derived.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

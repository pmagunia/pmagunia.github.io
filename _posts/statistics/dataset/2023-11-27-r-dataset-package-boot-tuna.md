<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">tuna</span> data set which pertains to Tuna Sighting Data. The <span class="mono">tuna</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">boot</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">tuna</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("tuna")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">tuna</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">tuna</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("boot")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-20702.csv">tuna R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The <code>tuna</code> data frame has 64 rows and 1 columns.</p>
<p>The data come from an aerial line transect survey of Southern Bluefin Tuna in the Great Australian Bight. An aircraft with two spotters on board flies randomly allocated line transects. Each school of tuna sighted is counted and its perpendicular distance from the transect measured. The survey was conducted in summer when tuna tend to stay on the surface.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>

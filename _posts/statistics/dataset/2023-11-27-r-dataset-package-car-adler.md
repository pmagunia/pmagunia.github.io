<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">Adler</span> data set which pertains to Experimenter Expectations. The <span class="mono">Adler</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">car</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">Adler</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("Adler")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">Adler</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">Adler</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("car")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-71014.csv">Adler R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The <code>Adler</code> data frame has 97 rows and 3 columns.</p>
<p>The “experimenters” were the actual subjects of the study. They collected ratings of the apparent successfulness of people in pictures who were pre-selected for their average appearance. The experimenters were told prior to collecting data that the pictures were either high or low in their appearance of success, and were instructed to get good data, scientific data, or were given no such instruction. Each experimenter collected ratings from 18 randomly assigned respondents; a few subjects were deleted at random to produce an unbalanced design.</p>

<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">BtheB</span> data set which pertains to Beat the Blues Data . The <span class="mono">BtheB</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">HSAUR</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">BtheB</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("BtheB")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">BtheB</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">BtheB</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("HSAUR")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-72268.csv">BtheB R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Longitudinal data from a clinical trial of an interactive, multimedia program known as "Beat the Blues" designed to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy to depressed patients via a computer terminal. Patients with depression recruited in primary care were randomised to either the Beating the Blues program, or to "Treatment as Usual (TAU)".</p>
<p>Note that the data are stored in the wide form, i.e., repeated measurments are represented by additional columns in the data frame.</p>

<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">ChemoTHC</span> data set which pertains to ChemoTHC. The <span class="mono">ChemoTHC</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">Stat2Data</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">ChemoTHC</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("ChemoTHC")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">ChemoTHC</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">ChemoTHC</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("Stat2Data")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-46075.csv">ChemoTHC R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>An article in the New England Journal of Medicine described a study on the effectiveness of medications for combatting nausea in patients undergoing chemotherapy treatments for cancer. In the experiment, 157 patients were divided at random into two groups. One group of 78 patients were given a standard antinausea drug called prochlorperazine, while the other group of 79 patients received THC (the active ingredient in marijuana). Both medications were delivered orally and no patients were told which of the two drugs they were taking. The response measured was whether or not the patient experienced relief from nausea when undergoing chemotherapy. Dataset is a 2x2 table of counts.</p>

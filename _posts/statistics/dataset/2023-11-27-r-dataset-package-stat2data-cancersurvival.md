<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">CancerSurvival</span> data set which pertains to CancerSurvival. The <span class="mono">CancerSurvival</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">Stat2Data</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">CancerSurvival</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("CancerSurvival")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">CancerSurvival</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">CancerSurvival</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("Stat2Data")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-89826.csv">CancerSurvival R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>In the 1970's doctors wondered if giving terminal cancer patients a supplement of ascorbate would prolong their lives. They designed an experiment to compare cancer patients who received ascorbate to cancer patients who did not receive the supplement. The result of that experiment was that, in fact, ascorbate did seem to prolong the lives of these patients. But then a second question arose. Was the effect of the ascorbate different when different organs were affected by the cancer? The researchers took a second look at the data. This time they concentrated only on those patients who received the ascorbate and divided the data up by which organ was affected by the cancer. They had 5 different organs represented among the patients (all of whom only had one organ affected): Stomach, bronchus, colon, ovary, and breast.</p>

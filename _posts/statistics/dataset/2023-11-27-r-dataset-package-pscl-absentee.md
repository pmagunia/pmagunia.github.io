<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">absentee</span> data set which pertains to Absentee and Machine Ballots in Pennsylvania State Senate Races. The <span class="mono">absentee</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">pscl</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">absentee</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("absentee")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">absentee</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">absentee</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("pscl")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-99508.csv">absentee R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>In November 1993, the state of Pennsylvania conducted elections for its state legislature. The result in the Senate election in the 2nd district (based in Philadelphia) was challenged in court, and ultimately overturned. The Democratic candidate won 19,127 of the votes cast by voting machine, while the Republican won 19,691 votes cast by voting machine, giving the Republican a lead of 564 votes. However, the Democrat won 1,396 absentee ballots, while the Republican won just 371 absentee ballots, more than offsetting the Republican lead based on the votes recorded by machines on election day. The Republican candidate sued, claiming that many of the absentee ballots were fraudulent. The judge in the case solicited expert analysis from Orley Ashenfelter, an economist at Princeton University. Ashenfelter examined the relationship between absentee vote margins and machine vote margins in 21 previous Pennsylvania Senate elections in seven districts in the Philadelphia area over the preceding decade.</p>

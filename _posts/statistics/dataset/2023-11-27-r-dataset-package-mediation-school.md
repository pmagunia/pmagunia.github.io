<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">school</span> data set which pertains to School-level data. The <span class="mono">school</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">mediation</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">school</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("school")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">school</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">school</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("mediation")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-51296.csv">school R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The original data source is the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002. To deal with the issue on individually identifiable information, we generated hypothetical student-level data using a multiple imputation method. The Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 used a two-stage sample selection process. First, a national sample of schools was selected using stratified probability proportional to size (PPS), and school contacting resulted in 1,221 eligible public, Catholic, and other private schools from a population of approximately 27,000 schools containing 10th grade students. Of the eligible schools, 752 participated in the study. In the second stage of sample selection, a sample of approximately 26 sophomores, from within each of the participating public and private schools was selected. Each school was asked to provide a list of 10th grade students, and quality assurance (QA) checks were performed on each list that was received.</p>

<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">ZeaMays</span> data set which pertains to Darwin's Heights of Cross- and Self-fertilized Zea May Pairs. The <span class="mono">ZeaMays</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">HistData</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">ZeaMays</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("ZeaMays")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">ZeaMays</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">ZeaMays</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("HistData")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Darwin (1876) studied the growth of pairs of zea may (aka corn) seedlings, one produced by cross-fertilization and the other produced by self-fertilization, but otherwise grown under identical conditions. His goal was to demonstrate the greater vigour of the cross-fertilized plants. The data recorded are the final height (inches, to the nearest 1/8th) of the plants in each pair.</p>
<p>In the <em>Design of Experiments</em>, Fisher (1935) used these data to illustrate a paired t-test (well, a one-sample test on the mean difference, <code>cross - self</code>). Later in the book (section 21), he used this data to illustrate an early example of a non-parametric permutation test, treating each paired difference as having (randomly) either a positive or negative sign.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre>data(ZeaMays)</pre>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>A data frame with 15 observations on the following 4 variables.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>pair</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>pair number, a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>pot</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>pot, a factor with levels <code>1</code> <code>2</code> <code>3</code> <code>4</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>cross</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>height of cross fertilized plant, a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>self</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>height of self fertilized plant, a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>diff</code></dt>
<dd>
<p><code>cross - self</code> for each pair</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>In addition to the standard paired t-test, several types of non-parametric tests can be contemplated:</p>
<p>(a) Permutation test, where the values of, say <code>self</code> are permuted and <code>diff=cross - self</code> is calculated for each permutation. There are 15! permutations, but a reasonably large number of random permutations would suffice. But this doesn't take the paired samples into account.</p>
<p>(b) Permutation test based on assigning each <code>abs(diff)</code> a + or - sign, and calculating the mean(diff). There are <i>2^{15}</i> such possible values. This is essentially what Fisher proposed. The p-value for the test is the proportion of absolute mean differences under such randomization which exceed the observed mean difference.</p>
<p>(c) Wilcoxon signed rank test: tests the hypothesis that the median signed rank of the <code>diff</code> is zero, or that the distribution of <code>diff</code> is symmetric about 0, vs. a location shifted alternative.</p>

<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">CHAIN</span> data set which pertains to Subset of variables from the CHAIN project. The <span class="mono">CHAIN</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">mi</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">CHAIN</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("CHAIN")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">CHAIN</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">CHAIN</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("mi")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-38134.csv">CHAIN R data set</a></span>. The size of this file is about 15,057 bytes.</p><h2>Subset of variables from the CHAIN project</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>

<pre>data(CHAIN)</pre>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>A <code>data.frame</code> with 532 observations on the following 8 variables.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>log_virus</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>log of self reported viral load level, where zero represents an undetectable level.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>age</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>age at time of the interview</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>income</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>annual family income in 10 intervals</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>healthy</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a continuous scale of physical health with a theoretical range between 0 and 100 where better health is associated with higher scale values</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mental</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a binary measure of poor mental health ( 1=Yes, 0=No )</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>damage</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>ordered interval for the CD4 count, which is an indicator of how much damage HIV has caused to the immune system</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>treatment</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a three-level ordered variable: 0=Not currently taking HAART (Highly Active AntiretRoviral Therapy) 1=taking HAART but nonadherent, 2=taking HAART and adherent</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>A missing value in the log virus load level was assigned to individuals who either could not recall their viral load level, did not have a viral load test in the six month preceding the interview, or reported their viral loads as "good" or "bad".</p>

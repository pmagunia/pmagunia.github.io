<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">coal</span> data set which pertains to Dates of Coal Mining Disasters . The <span class="mono">coal</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">boot</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">coal</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("coal")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">coal</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">coal</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("boot")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>.

<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">calcium</span> data set which pertains to Calcium Uptake Data. The <span class="mono">calcium</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">boot</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">calcium</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("calcium")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">calcium</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">calcium</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("boot")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-60234.csv">calcium R data set</a></span>. The size of this file is about 345 bytes.</p><h2>Calcium Uptake Data</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The <code>calcium</code> data frame has 27 rows and 2 columns.</p>
<p>Howard Grimes from the Botany Department, North Carolina State University, conducted an experiment for biochemical analysis of intracellular storage and transport of calcium across plasma membrane. Cells were suspended in a solution of radioactive calcium for a certain length of time and then the amount of radioactive calcium that was absorbed by the cells was measured. The experiment was repeated independently with 9 different times of suspension each replicated 3 times.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre>
calcium
</pre>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>This data frame contains the following columns:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>time</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The time (in minutes) that the cells were suspended in the solution.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>cal</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The amount of calcium uptake (nmoles/mg).</p>
</dd>
</dl>

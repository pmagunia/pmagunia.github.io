<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">sleepstudy</span> data set which pertains to Reaction times in a sleep deprivation study. The <span class="mono">sleepstudy</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">lme4</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">sleepstudy</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("sleepstudy")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">sleepstudy</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">sleepstudy</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("lme4")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-85663.csv">sleepstudy R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The average reaction time per day for subjects in a sleep deprivation study. On day 0 the subjects had their normal amount of sleep. Starting that night they were restricted to 3 hours of sleep per night. The observations represent the average reaction time on a series of tests given each day to each subject.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>A data frame with 180 observations on the following 3 variables.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>Reaction</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Average reaction time (ms)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Days</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of days of sleep deprivation</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Subject</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Subject number on which the observation was made.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>These data are from the study described in Belenky et al. (2003), for the sleep-deprived group and for the first 10 days of the study, up to the recovery period.</p>

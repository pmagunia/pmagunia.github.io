<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">cane</span> data set which pertains to Sugar-cane Disease Data. The <span class="mono">cane</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">boot</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">cane</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("cane")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">cane</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">cane</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("boot")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-45265.csv">cane R data set</a></span>. The size of this file is about 3,208 bytes.</p><h2>Sugar-cane Disease Data</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The <code>cane</code> data frame has 180 rows and 5 columns. The data frame represents a randomized block design with 45 varieties of sugar-cane and 4 blocks.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre>
cane
</pre>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>This data frame contains the following columns:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>n</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The total number of shoots in each plot.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>r</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of diseased shoots.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>x</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of pieces of the stems, out of 50, planted in each plot.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>var</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor indicating the variety of sugar-cane in each plot.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>block</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor for the blocks.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The aim of the experiment was to classify the varieties into resistant, intermediate and susceptible to a disease called "coal of sugar-cane" (carvao da cana-de-acucar). This is a disease that is common in sugar-cane plantations in certain areas of Brazil.</p>
<p>For each plot, fifty pieces of sugar-cane stem were put in a solution containing the disease agent and then some were planted in the plot. After a fixed period of time, the total number of shoots and the number of diseased shoots were recorded.</p>

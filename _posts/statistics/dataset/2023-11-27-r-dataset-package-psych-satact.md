<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">sat.act</span> data set which pertains to 3 Measures of ability: SATV, SATQ, ACT. The <span class="mono">sat.act</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">psych</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">sat.act</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("sat.act")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">sat.act</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">sat.act</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("psych")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-44943.csv">sat.act R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>hese items were collected as part of the SAPA project (<a href="http://sapa-project.org">http://sapa-project.org</a>)to develop online measures of ability (Revelle, Wilt and Rosenthal, 2009). The score means are higher than national norms suggesting both self selection for people taking on line personality and ability tests and a self reporting bias in scores.</p>

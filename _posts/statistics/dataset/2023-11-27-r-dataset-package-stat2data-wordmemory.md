<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">WordMemory</span> data set which pertains to WordMemory. The <span class="mono">WordMemory</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">Stat2Data</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">WordMemory</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("WordMemory")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">WordMemory</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">WordMemory</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("Stat2Data")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-53253.csv">WordMemory R data set</a></span>. The size of this file is about 762 bytes.</p><h2>WordMemory</h2>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>One hundred words were presented to each subject in a randomized order. The goal of the experiment was to see whether some kinds of words were easier to remember than others. In particular, are common words like potato, love, diet, and magazine easier to remember than less common words like manatee, hangnail, fillip, and apostasy? Are concrete words like coffee, dog, kale, and tamborine easier than abstract words like beauty, sympathy, fauna, and guile? There were 25 words each of four kinds, obtained by crossing the two factors of interest, Abstraction (concrete or abstract) and Frequency (common or rare).</p>

<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">Dimes</span> data set which pertains to Weight of dimes. The <span class="mono">Dimes</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">mosaicData</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">Dimes</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("Dimes")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">Dimes</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">Dimes</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("mosaicData")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-30552.csv">Dimes R data set</a></span>.

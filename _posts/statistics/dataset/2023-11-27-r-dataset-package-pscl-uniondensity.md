<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">unionDensity</span> data set which pertains to cross national rates of trade union density. The <span class="mono">unionDensity</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">pscl</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">unionDensity</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("unionDensity")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">unionDensity</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">unionDensity</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("pscl")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-39173.csv">unionDensity R data set</a></span>. The size of this file is about 805 bytes.</p><h2>cross national rates of trade union density</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Cross-national data on relative size of the trade unions and predictors, in 20 countries. Two of the predictors are highly collinear, and are the source of a debate between Stephens and Wallerstein (1991), later reviewed by Western and Jackman (1994).</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre>data(unionDensity)
</pre>
<h3>Format</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>union</code>numeric, percentage of the total number of wage and salary earners plus the unemployed who are union members, measured between 1975 and 1980, with most of the data drawn from 1979</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>left</code>numeric, an index tapping the extent to which parties of the left have controlled governments since 1919, due to Wilensky (1981).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>size</code>numeric, log of labor force size, defined as the number of wage and salary earners, plus the unemployed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>concen</code>numeric, percentage of employment, shipments, or production accounted for by the four largest enterprises in a particular industry, averaged over industries (with weights proportional to the size of the industry) and the resulting measure is normalized such that the United States scores a 1.0, and is due to Pryor (1973). Some of the scores on this variable are imputed using procedures described in Stephens and Wallerstein (1991, 945).</p>
</li>
</ul>

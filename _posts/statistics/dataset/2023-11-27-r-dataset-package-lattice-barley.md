<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">barley</span> data set which pertains to Yield data from a Minnesota barley trial . The <span class="mono">barley</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">lattice</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">barley</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("barley")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">barley</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">barley</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("lattice")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-60148.csv">barley R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>These data are yields in bushels per acre, of 10 varieties of barley grown in 1/40 acre plots at University Farm, St. Paul, and at the five branch experiment stations located at Waseca, Morris, Crookston, Grand Rapids, and Duluth (all in Minnesota). The varieties were grown in three randomized blocks at each of the six stations during 1931 and 1932, different land being used each year of the test.</p>
<p>Immer et al. (1934) present the data for each Year*Site*Variety*Block. The data here is the average yield across the three blocks.</p>
<p>Immer et al. (1934) refer (once) to the experiment as being conducted in 1930 and 1931, then later refer to it (repeatedly) as being conducted in 1931 and 1932. Later authors have continued the confusion.</p>
<p>Cleveland (1993) suggests that the data for the Morris site may have had the years switched.</p>

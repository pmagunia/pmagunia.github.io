<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">USclassifiedDocuments</span> data set which pertains to Official Secrecy of the United States Government . The <span class="mono">USclassifiedDocuments</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">Ecdat</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">USclassifiedDocuments</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("USclassifiedDocuments")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">USclassifiedDocuments</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">USclassifiedDocuments</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("Ecdat")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-90051.csv">USclassifiedDocuments R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Data on classification activity of the United States government.</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick (2013) notes that the dramatic jump in derivative classification activity (<code>DerivClassActivity</code>) that occurred in 2009 coincided with "New guidance issued to include electronic environment". Apart from the jump in 2009, the <code>DerivClassActivity</code> tended to increase by roughly 12 percent per year (with a standard deviation of the increase in the natural logarithm of <code>DerivClassActivity</code> of 0.18).</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre>
data(USclassifiedDocuments)
</pre>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>A dataframe containing :</p>
<dl>
<dt>year</dt>
<dd>
<p>the calendar year</p>
</dd>
<dt>OCAuthority</dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of people in the government designated as Original Classification Authorities for the indicated <code>year</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>OCActivity</dt>
<dd>
<p>Original classification activity for the indicated year: These are the number of documents created with an original classification, i.e., so designated by an official Original Classification Authority.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TenYearDeclass</dt>
<dd>
<p>Percent of <code>OCActivity</code> covered by the 10 year declassification rules.</p>
</dd>
<dt>DerivClassActivity</dt>
<dd>
<p>Derivative classification activity for the indicated year: These are the number of documents created that claim another document as the authority for classification.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The lag 1 autocorrrelation of the first difference of the logarithms of <code>DerivClassActivity</code> through 2008 is <code>-0.52</code>. However, because there are only 13 numbers (12 differences), this negative correlation is not statistically significant.</p>

<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">wool</span> data set which pertains to Australian Relative Wool Prices. The <span class="mono">wool</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">boot</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">wool</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("wool")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">wool</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">wool</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("boot")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><code>wool</code> is a time series of class <code>"ts"</code> and contains 309 observations.</p>
<p>Each week that the market is open the Australian Wool Corporation set a floor price which determines their policy on intervention and is therefore a reflection of the overall price of wool for the week in question. Actual prices paid can vary considerably about the floor price. The series here is the log of the ratio between the price for fine grade wool and the floor price, each market week between July 1976 and Jun 1984.</p>

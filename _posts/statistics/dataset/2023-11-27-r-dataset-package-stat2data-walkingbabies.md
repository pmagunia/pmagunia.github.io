<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">WalkingBabies</span> data set which pertains to WalkingBabies. The <span class="mono">WalkingBabies</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">Stat2Data</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">WalkingBabies</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("WalkingBabies")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">WalkingBabies</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">WalkingBabies</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("Stat2Data")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command.

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Scientists wondered if they could get babies to walk sooner by prescribing a set of special exercises. Their experimental design included four groups of babies and the following treatments:Special exercises: Parents were shown the special exercises and encouraged to use them with their children. They were phoned weekly to check on their child's progress.Exercise control: These parents were not shown the special exercises, but they were told to make sure their babies spent at least 15 minutes a day exercising.Weekly report: Parents in this group were not given instructions about exercise. Like the parents in the treatment group, however, they received a phone call each week to check on progress.Final report: These parents were not given weekly phone calls or instructions about exercises. They reported at the end of the study.</p>

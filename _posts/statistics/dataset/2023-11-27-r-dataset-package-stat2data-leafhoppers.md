<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">LeafHoppers</span> data set which pertains to LeafHoppers. The <span class="mono">LeafHoppers</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">Stat2Data</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">LeafHoppers</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("LeafHoppers")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">LeafHoppers</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">LeafHoppers</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("Stat2Data")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-13488.csv">LeafHoppers R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Lefetimes for potato leafhoppers on various sugar diets</p>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The goal of this study was to compare the effects of four diets on the lifespan of small insects called potato leafhoppers. One of the four was a control diet: just distilled water with no nutritive value. Each of the other three diets had a particular sugar added to the distilled water, one of glucose, sucrose, or fructose. Leafhoppers were sorted into groups of eight and each group was put into one of eight lab dishes. Each of the four diets was added to two dishes, chosen using chance.</p>

<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">chickwts</span> data set which pertains to Chicken Weights by Feed Type. The <span class="mono">chickwts</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">datasets</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">chickwts</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("chickwts")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">chickwts</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">chickwts</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("datasets")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-57787.csv">chickwts R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Format</h3>
<p>A data frame with 71 observations on the following 2 variables.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>weight</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric variable giving the chick weight.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>feed</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor giving the feed type.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Newly hatched chicks were randomly allocated into six groups, and each group was given a different feed supplement. Their weights in grams after six weeks are given along with feed types.</p>

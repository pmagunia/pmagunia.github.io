<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">ducks</span> data set which pertains to Behavioral and Plumage Characteristics of Hybrid Ducks. The <span class="mono">ducks</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">boot</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">ducks</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("ducks")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">ducks</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">ducks</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("boot")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-71947.csv">ducks R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The <code>ducks</code> data frame has 11 rows and 2 columns.</p>
<p>Each row of the data frame represents a male duck who is a second generation cross of mallard and pintail ducks. For 11 such ducks a behavioural and plumage index were calculated. These were measured on scales devised for this experiment which was to examine whether there was any link between which species the ducks resembled physically and which they resembled in behaviour. The scale for the physical appearance ranged from 0 (identical in appearance to a mallard) to 20 (identical to a pintail). The behavioural traits of the ducks were on a scale from 0 to 15 with lower numbers indicating closer to mallard-like in behaviour.</p>

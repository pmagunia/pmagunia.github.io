<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">mao</span> data set which pertains to A study of Parkinson's disease and MAO gene. The <span class="mono">mao</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">gap</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">mao</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("mao")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">mao</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">mao</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("gap")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-81704.csv">mao R data set</a></span>. The size of this file is about 34,750 bytes.</p><h2>A study of Parkinson's disease and MAO gene</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The markers are both with actual allele sizes and allele numbers. The dataset is distributed with the GENECOUNTING version 2.0 illustrating gene counting method involving chromosome X. A total of 183 patients and 157 controls (150 males, 190 females) were available, together with five markers in MAOA (monoamine oxidase A) region with alleles 12, 9, 6, 5, 3, and the first three markers were genotyped in all individuals while the fourth and fifth were genotyped for 294 and 304 individuals.</p>

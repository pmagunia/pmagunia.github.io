<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">WeightLossIncentive7</span> data set which pertains to WeightLossIncentive7. The <span class="mono">WeightLossIncentive7</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">Stat2Data</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">WeightLossIncentive7</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("WeightLossIncentive7")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">WeightLossIncentive7</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">WeightLossIncentive7</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("Stat2Data")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>.

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Researchers investigated whether financial incentives would help people lose weight more successfully. Some participants in the study were randomly assigned to a treatment group that was offered financial incentives for achieving weight loss goals, while others were assigned to a control group that did not use financial incentives. All participants were monitored over a four month period and the net weight change (Before - After in pounds) at the end of this period was recorded for each individual. Then the individuals were left alone for three months with a followup weight check at the seven-month mark to see whether weight losses persisted after the original four months of treatment. This dataset has only the non-missing 7-month data. The 4-month data are in WeightLossIncentive4 and both measurements (including missing values) are in WeightLossIncentive.</p>

<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">cd4</span> data set which pertains to CD4 Counts for HIV-Positive Patients. The <span class="mono">cd4</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">boot</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">cd4</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("cd4")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">cd4</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">cd4</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("boot")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-33868.csv">cd4 R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The <code>cd4</code> data frame has 20 rows and 2 columns.</p>
<p>CD4 cells are carried in the blood as part of the human immune system. One of the effects of the HIV virus is that these cells die. The count of CD4 cells is used in determining the onset of full-blown AIDS in a patient. In this study of the effectiveness of a new anti-viral drug on HIV, 20 HIV-positive patients had their CD4 counts recorded and then were put on a course of treatment with this drug. After using the drug for one year, their CD4 counts were again recorded. The aim of the experiment was to show that patients taking the drug had increased CD4 counts which is not generally seen in HIV-positive patients.</p>

<p>These data were originally collected by L.M. Linde of UCLA but were first published by M.R. Mickey, O.J. Dunn, and V. Clark, "Note on the use of stepwise regression in detecting outliers," Computers and Biomedical Research, 1 (1967), pp. 105-111. The data have been used by several authors. We found them in David Moore's Basic Practice of Statistics, WH Freeman (2004)</p>

<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">neuro</span> data set which pertains to Neurophysiological Point Process Data. The <span class="mono">neuro</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">boot</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">neuro</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("neuro")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">neuro</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">neuro</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("boot")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-79459.csv">neuro R data set</a></span>. The size of this file is about 13,879 bytes.</p><h2>Neurophysiological Point Process Data</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p><code>neuro</code> is a matrix containing times of observed firing of a neuron in windows of 250ms either side of the application of a stimulus to a human subject. Each row of the matrix is a replication of the experiment and there were a total of 469 replicates.</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>There are a lot of missing values in the matrix as different numbers of firings were observed in different replicates. The number of firings observed varied from 2 to 6.</p>
<h3>Source</h3>
<p>The data were collected and kindly made available by Dr. S.J. Boniface of the Neurophysiology Unit at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford.</p>

<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">Ethanol</span> data set which pertains to Ethanol. The <span class="mono">Ethanol</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">Stat2Data</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">Ethanol</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("Ethanol")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">Ethanol</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">Ethanol</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("Stat2Data")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-96695.csv">Ethanol R data set</a></span>. The size of this file is about 293 bytes.</p><h2>Ethanol</h2>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Many biochemical reactions are slowed or prevented by the presence of oxygen. For example, there are two simple forms of fermentation, one which converts each molecule of sugar to two molecules of lactic acid, and a second which converts each molecule of sugar to one each of lactic acid, ethanol, and carbon dioxide. This experiment was designed to compare the inhibiting effect of oxygen on the metabolism of two different sugars, glucose and galactose, by Streptococcus bacteria. In this case there were four levels of oxygen that were applied to the two kinds of sugar.</p>

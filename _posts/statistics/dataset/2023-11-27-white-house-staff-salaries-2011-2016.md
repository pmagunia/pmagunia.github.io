<h2>White House Staff Salaries 2011-16</h2>
<p>White House salary data formerly available at open.whitehouse.gov. As of February 9, 2017, <a href="https://open.whitehouse.gov">https://open.whitehouse.gov</a> contains no datasets.</p>
<p>Since 1995, the White House has been required to deliver a report to Congress listing the title and salary of every White House Office employee. Consistent with President Obama's commitment to transparency, this report is being publicly disclosed on our website as it is transmitted to Congress. In addition, this report also contains the title and salary details of administration officials who work at the Office of Policy Development, including the Domestic Policy Council and the National Economic Council -- along with White House Office employees.</p>

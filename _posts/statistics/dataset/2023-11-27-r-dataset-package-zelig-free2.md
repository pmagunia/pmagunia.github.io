<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">free2</span> data set which pertains to Freedom of Speech Data. The <span class="mono">free2</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">Zelig</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">free2</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("free2")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">free2</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">free2</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("Zelig")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-77068.csv">free2 R data set</a></span>.

<p>ySelf assessment (see below).</p>

<li>
<p>v1-v6Response to vignettes (see below).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Survey respondents were asked in almost the same language for a self-assessment and for an assessment of several hypothetical persons described by written vignettes. The self assessment (<code>self</code>, in the data set), "How free do you think [name/you] [is/are] to express [him-her/your]self without fear of government reprisal?" was first asked of the survey respondent with respect to him or herself, and then after each of vignette. The possible response categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1Completely free</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2Very free</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3Moderately free</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4Slightly free</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5Not free at all</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The vignettes, ordered from most free to least free, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>vign1[Kay] does not like many of the government's policies. She frequently publishes her opinion in newspapers, criticizing decisions by officials and calling for change. She sees little reason these actions could lead to government reprisal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vign2[Michael] disagrees with many of the government's policies. Though he knows criticism is frowned upon, he doesn't believe the government would punish someone for expressing critical views. He makes his opinion known on most issues without regard to who is listening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vign3[Bob] has political views at odds with the government. He has heard of people occasionally being arrested for speaking out against the government, and government leaders sometimes make political speeches condemning those who criticize. He sometimes writes letters to newspapers about politics, but he is careful not to use his real name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vign4[Connie] does not like the government's stance on many issues. She has a friend who was arrested for being too openly critical of governmental leaders, and so she avoids voicing her opinions in public places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vign5[Vito] disagrees with many of the government's policies, and is very careful about whom he says this to, reserving his real opinions for family and close friends only. He knows several men who have been taken away by government officials for saying negative things in public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vign6[Sonny] lives in fear of being harassed for his political views. Everyone he knows who has spoken out against the government has been arrested or taken away. He never says a word about anything the government does, not even when he is at home alone with his family.</p>
</li>
</ul>

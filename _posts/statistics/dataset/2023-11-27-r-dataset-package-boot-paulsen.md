<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">paulsen</span> data set which pertains to Neurotransmission in Guinea Pig Brains. The <span class="mono">paulsen</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">boot</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">paulsen</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("paulsen")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">paulsen</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">paulsen</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("boot")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-68181.csv">paulsen R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The <code>paulsen</code> data frame has 346 rows and 1 columns.</p>
<p>Sections were prepared from the brain of adult guinea pigs. Spontaneous currents that flowed into individual brain cells were then recorded and the peak amplitude of each current measured. The aim of the experiment was to see if the current flow was quantal in nature (i.e. that it is not a single burst but instead is built up of many smaller bursts of current). If the current was indeed quantal then it would be expected that the distribution of the current amplitude would be multimodal with modes at regular intervals. The modes would be expected to decrease in magnitude for higher current amplitudes.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">FishEggs</span> data set which pertains to FishEggs. The <span class="mono">FishEggs</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">Stat2Data</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">FishEggs</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("FishEggs")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">FishEggs</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">FishEggs</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("Stat2Data")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-65268.csv">FishEggs R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Researchers collected samples of female lake trout from Lake Ontario in September and November of 2002 through 2004. A goal of the study was to investigate the fertility of fish that had been stocked in the lake. One measure of the viability of fish eggs is percent dry mass(PctDM) which reflects the energy potential stored in the eggs by recording the percentage of the total egg material that is solid. Values of the PctDM for a sample of 35 lake trout (14 in September and 21 in November) are given in this dataset along with the age (in years) of the fish.</p>

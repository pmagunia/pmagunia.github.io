<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">darwin</span> data set which pertains to Darwin's Plant Height Differences . The <span class="mono">darwin</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">boot</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">darwin</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("darwin")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">darwin</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">darwin</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("boot")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-61739.csv">darwin R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The <code>darwin</code> data frame has 15 rows and 1 columns.</p>
<p>Charles Darwin conducted an experiment to examine the superiority of cross-fertilized plants over self-fertilized plants. 15 pairs of plants were used. Each pair consisted of one cross-fertilized plant and one self-fertilized plant which germinated at the same time and grew in the same pot. The plants were measured at a fixed time after planting and the difference in heights between the cross- and self-fertilized plants are recorded in eighths of an inch.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>

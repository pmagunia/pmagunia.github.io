<p>On this R-data statistics page, you will find information about the <span class="mono">downs.bc</span> data set which pertains to Incidence of Down's Syndrome in British Columbia. The <span class="mono">downs.bc</span> data set is found in the <span class="mono">boot</span> R package. You can load the <span class="mono">downs.bc</span> data set in R by issuing the following command at the console <span class="mono">data("downs.bc")</span>. This will load the data into a variable called <span class="mono">downs.bc</span>. If R says the <span class="mono">downs.bc</span> data set is not found, you can try installing the package by issuing this command <span class="mono">install.packages("boot")</span> and then attempt to reload the data with the <span class="mono">library()</span> command. If you need to download R, you can go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R project website</a>. You can download a CSV (comma separated values) version of the <span class="mono"><a href="../assets/data/csv/dataset-80534.csv">downs.bc R data set</a></span>.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The <code>downs.bc</code> data frame has 30 rows and 3 columns.</p>
<p>Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by an extra chromosome 21 or a part of chromosome 21 being translocated to another chromosome. The incidence of Down's syndrome is highly dependent on the mother's age and rises sharply after age 30. In the 1960's a large scale study of the effect of maternal age on the incidence of Down's syndrome was conducted at the British Columbia Health Surveillance Registry. These are the data which was collected in that study.</p>
<p>Mothers were classified by age. Most groups correspond to the age in years but the first group comprises all mothers with ages in the range 15-17 and the last is those with ages 46-49. No data for mothers over 50 or below 15 were collected.</p>

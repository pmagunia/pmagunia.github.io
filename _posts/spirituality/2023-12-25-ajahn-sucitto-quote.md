<a href="https://www.waltopie.com">Walt Opie</a> referenced this quote of Ajahn Sacitto in his free book <strong>Parimi</strong>. "In fact our craving is about something we don't have. We can't crave something we already have...Sexuality and food are not really the source of craving. The source is the not having...If giving something up encourages craving, why do it? Well, apart from enjoying simplicity, a big reason to renounce is in order to understand and thereby undo craving. What we are primarily giving up is this sense of absence — the feeling of 'I need, I want, I am incomplete without.' That's what we’re giving up."

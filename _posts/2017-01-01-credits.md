<p>A lot of things came together for this website to happen. I'm listing the few that come to mind</p>
<p>The flag icon found in the footer is public domain. I found it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_United_States.svg">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>This page is hosted on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/pmagunia/pmagunia.github.io">repository link</a>, if you would like to browse the code.</p>
<p>The text editor used for these pages is <a href="https://www.vim.org">Vim</a> on a <a href="https://www.apple.com">Mac</a> computer.</p>
<p>The Prologue theme for this website was originally designed by <a href="https://html5up.net/prologue">HTML5 Up</a>. <a href="https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue">Chris Bobbe</a> adapted the theme for <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Both themes are licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported</a>. Modifications of the Jekyll theme were made by Parag Magunia.</p>
<p>Even though the United States can get alot of bad press, there are alot of good people here. I'm thankful to live and work here.</p>
<p>My dad who worked so hard to see my sister and I were able to get a good education.</p>
<p>My mom who is still with me. I wouldn't be alive today without her.</p>

<p>When I am not at work, I can be found meditating, working on this website which is maintained with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, and listening to music. At the bottom left, I have social media links to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/pmagunia">Drupal</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pmagunia">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmagunia/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pmagunia">Github</a>, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~015b1032d2938319a8?viewMode=1">Upwork</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pmagunia">SoundCloud</a>, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/312471/pmagunia">StackOverflow</a>. I've also included about <a href="/datasets.html">1500 datasets</a> which were imported from <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> and <a href="https://www.openintro.org">Open Intro</a> with some added value.</p>

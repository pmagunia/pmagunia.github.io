Both were related to Drupal with some hints of AWS. I got to configure load balancers and also a large RDS MySQL instance. I signed non-disclosure agreements with my client's so I'm not able to mention their name though one of them was a large food service company based out of the midwest US and the other was for a travel sight that sees a lot of visitors.</p> <p>As I'm currently a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I'm limiting the amount of work I do. You can find out more about my education on my <a href="/2019/07/06/beginnings.html">Illinois blog post</a>. It lists the mentions the Illinois MCS program which I'm enrolled in. I'm able to balance my work life and school life without much effort most of the time. I watch the lectures and do machine problems on the weekend.</p> <p>You can find out more about <a href="https://www.northpenn.net">North Penn Networks</a> at it's website. North Penn Networks is my single member limited liability company I do work out of. I figure a LLC provides more liability protection than a sole proprietorship so on all my contracts I sign it with my company. I haven't run into any problems (knock on wood) but I try to be careful. At one point my company was insured through <a href="https://www.hiscox.com">Hiscox</a>. They provided some peace-of-mind for the travel agency site I was working on at a very reasonable rate - I think it was around $40 per month. I didn't have to see an agent and I did everything online. If you want to cancel, you do have to call their number. I got a pro-rated refund when I cancelled. I'm not affiliated with them but if you are looking for business liability protection I do recommend them.</p> </div> </article> </div> <div id="footer"> <ul class="copyright"> <li>&copy; Parag Magunia or affialiates <img src="/assets/images/flag.svg" height="16px" width="30px" alt="A photo of the United States Flag" class="my_home"></li> <li><a href="/sitemap.xml">Sitemap</a></li> <li><a href="https://pmagunia.com/2017/01/01/credits.html">Credits</a></li> <li><a href="/2017/01/01/privacy.html">Privacy</a></li> <li><a href="/2017/01/01/terms.html">Terms</a></li> <li><a target="_blank" href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmagunia.com%2F">Page Speed</a></li> </ul> </div> </body> </html>

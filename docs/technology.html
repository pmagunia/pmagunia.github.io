That’s the one for artificial intelligence at the practitioner level. My computer science training at UIUC helped me alot for understanding concepts like tokens and recall. I had to refresh my memory about F1 scores, logistic regression, and linear regression from statistics at WVU too. It was a challenging exam. Much more difficult than the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam which didn’t require any concepts from computer science. If I remember correctly, the Cloud Pracitioner exam covered topics mostly from AWS Services, like what is EC2 and Route 53.

I think my company will reimburse me for the expense of the exam. I didn’t prep alot.

It has changed a lot from SAA-C02. There is a new section on Data Lakes and more percentage of questions devoted to building secure applications. The first time I took the new C03 exam I failed, and I was very disappointed as I was expecting to pass since I already had an expired C02 credential. What helped me the most this time was the Coursera AWS Solutions Architect specialization, the AWS FAQs and hands-on experience.

Both were related to Drupal with some hints of AWS. I got to configure load balancers and also a large RDS MySQL instance.

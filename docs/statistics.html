To understand this relationship, I took my survey data from Open Intro and focused on the following three variables for counties in Pennsylvania using only the D3 JavaScript library for data visualization. Please note that data for some counties were missing for 2019. Percent of the county population in poverty - poverty_2019Percent of the county with a bachelors degree - bachelors_2019Population of the county - pop_2019 The data seems to corroborate the negative relationship as most people would likely imagine.

It shows the relationship between poverty and education in the counties of Pennsylvania. You can see the general trend is negative. In other words, as more and more people become educated, the respective poverty level of their counties decreases. You can visit and interact with the dashboard on the Tableau page on my website. The following is some question and answer about my Tableau app. </p><a href="https://pmagunia.com/statistics/tableau-dashboard.html">read more</a></div> </section> <section id="binomial-distribution" class="shade-three"> <div class="container"><header> <h2><a href="https://pmagunia.com/statistics/binomial-distribution.html">Binomial Distribution</a></h2> </header><p>In the last section, we took a first look at the some of the conditions necessary for a binomial experiment.

That is getting 2 fewer heads than would be expected by chance alone if the coin is indeed fair. Now we need to calculate the p-value of the experiment. The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the observed value. In this case, our observed value is three. More extreme cases would be if we flipped the coin and we get 0, 1, or 2 heads. However, this is a two-sided test so we can get extreme cases on...</p><a href="https://pmagunia.com/statistics/binomial-hypothesis-testing-i.html">read more</a></div> </section> <section id="binomial-testing" class="shade-four"> <div class="container"><header> <h2><a href="https://pmagunia.com/statistics/binomial-hypothesis-testing-ii.html">Binomial Testing</a></h2> </header><p>In the last experiment, we assumed we had a fair coin.

You can think of the mean as a typical representative value of all the observations in a set. The standard deviation is a measure of the “spread” of the data. For example, if in a set of observations, the data was not concentrated around the mean, then that dataset would have a high standard deviation. If all the data, was concentrated around some single value, then that dataset would have a low standard deviation. The standard deviation squared is the variance. Another name for these measurements are moments. </p><a href="https://pmagunia.com/statistics/moments.html">read more</a></div> </section> <section id="random-variables" class="shade-two"> <div class="container"><header> <h2><a href="https://pmagunia.com/statistics/random-variables.html">Random Variables</a></h2> </header><p>A random variable, $ X $, is a function that assigns to each element in the sample space a unique value. The sample space is the domain of $X$. The value assigned to each element in the sample space is the probability for that particular element in the sample space occurring. The sum of the probabilities over the sample space must equal 1, and the probability that the random variable takes on a value $ x $ must be between 0 and 1, inclusive. </p><a href="https://pmagunia.com/statistics/random-variables.html">read more</a></div> </section> <section id="statistical-populations" class="shade-three"> <div class="container"><header> <h2><a href="https://pmagunia.com/statistics/statistical-populations.html">Statistical Populations</a></h2> </header><p>In statistics, we are often interested in the population which is some entire set of entities that share a common trait.

Integer any whole number including 0 such as 1, 2, or 3. $\frac{1}{2}$ is not a integer. $0.333\bar{3}$ is not an integer. $\frac{6}{3}$ is an integer even though it is a fraction because it reduces to 2 which is an integer. Negative whole numbers are also integers. The symbol for integers in mathematics is $\mathbb{Z}$ named after the German word 'zahlen.' Even Number Any number, $n$, that can be expressed as a multiple of 2. Now, 0 is an even number because $0 = 2 \cdot 0$.

I've never seen the number five walking in my neighborhood or any other number for that fact. In this respect math is different from other sciences than say, chemistry, where atoms can be reached out and touched or geology where the Earth can be walked upon.
